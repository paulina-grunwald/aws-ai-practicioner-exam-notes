# Terminology

- **Clustering**. Unsupervised learning task that helps to determine if there are any naturally occurring groupings in the data.
- A ***categorical label*** has a discrete set of possible values, such as "is a cat" and "is not a cat."
- A **continuous (regression) label** does not have a discrete set of possible values, which means possibly an unlimited number of possibilities.
- **Discrete**: A term taken from statistics referring to an outcome taking on only a finite number of values (such as days of the week).
- A **label** refers to data that already contains the solution.
- Using **unlabeled** data means you don't need to provide the model with any kind of label or solution while the model is being trained.
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** – generate human text or computer code based on input prompts
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** – similar intent to GPT,
but reads the text in two directions
- **RNN** (Recurrent Neural Network) – meant for sequential data such as time-series or text,
useful in speech recognition, time-series prediction
- **ResNet** (Residual Network) – Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for image recognition tasks, object detection, facial recognition
- SVM (Support Vector Machine) – ML algorithm for classification and regression
- **WaveNet** – model to generate raw audio waveform, used in Speech Synthesis
- **GAN** (Generative Adversarial Network) – models used to generate synthetic data such as images, videos or sounds that resemble the training data. Helpful for data augmentation
- **XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting) – an implementation of gradient boosting
