- **Machine learning (ML)** is a modern software development technique and a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data. It allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.
- A **model** is an extremely generic program, made specific by the data used to train it.
- **Model training algorithms** work through an interactive process where the current model iteration is analyzed to determine what changes can be made to get closer to the goal. Those changes are made and the iteration continues until the model is evaluated to meet the goals.
- **Model inference** is when the trained model is used to generate predictions.
- **Modal Parameter -** A variable that configures the **internal** state of a model who's **value can be estimated**. The value of the parameter is not manually set and will be learned and outputted after training Parameters are used to make predictions
- **Model Hyperparameter -** a variable is external to model and who's value cannot be estimated. The value of hyperparameter is manually set before the training of the model Hyperparameters to estimate the model's parameters:
  - learning rate
  - epochs
  - batch size
- **Impute** is a common term referring to different statistical tools which can be used to calculate missing values from your dataset.
- **Outliers** are data points that are significantly different from others in the same sample.
