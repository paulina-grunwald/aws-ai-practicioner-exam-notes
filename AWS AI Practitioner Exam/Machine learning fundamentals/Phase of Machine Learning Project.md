# Phase of Machine Learning Project

1. **Define business goals**
• Stakeholders define the value, budget and success criteria
• Defining KPI (Key Performance Indicators) is critical
2. **ML problem framing**
• Convert the business problem and into a machine learning problem
• Determine if ML is appropriate
• Data scientist, data engineers and ML architects and subject matter experts
(SME) collaborate
3. **Data processing**
• Convert the data into a usable format
• Data collection and integration (make it centrally accessible)
• Data preprocessing and data visualization (understandable format)
• Feature engineering: create, transform and extract variables from data
4. **Model development**
• Model training, tuning, and evaluation
• Iterative process
• Additional feature engineering and tune model hyperparameters

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Visualize the data with graphs
- Correlation Matrix:
    - Look at correlations between variables (how “linked” they are)
    - Helps you decide which features can be important in your model
