# Self-Supervised Learning

**Self-supervised learning** is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from data without requiring manually labeled examples. Instead, the data itself generates the supervision (labels) needed for training. It is often considered a middle ground between **unsupervised learning** (no labels) and **supervised learning** (requires labeled data).

This approach has gained prominence in tasks like natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and speech recognition, as it enables models to learn from large amounts of unlabeled data, which is more readily available than labeled data.
