# AI Service Cards

AWS AI Service Cards are a form of responsible AI documentation introduced by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to enhance transparency and help customers better understand their AI services. These cards provide a centralized resource detailing the intended use cases, limitations, responsible AI design choices, and best practices for deployment and operation of AWS AI services. 

**Key Components of AWS AI Service Cards:**

•	**Intended Use Cases and Limitations:** Clearly outlines the scenarios for which the AI service is designed, as well as any constraints or situations where its use may not be appropriate.

•	**Responsible AI Design Considerations:** Discusses the ethical and responsible design principles incorporated into the service, addressing aspects such as fairness, explainability, robustness, governance, transparency, privacy, and security.

•	**Deployment and Performance Optimization Guidance:** Offers best practices for effectively deploying and optimizing the AI service to achieve optimal performance.
